### Metro Nashville Open Data Cleanup &amp; Analysis

#### Steps in this Data Problem include

1. Determine and implement a strategy to reduce the 900+ violation types listed
in the spreadsheet "Codes' List of Violations 15 aug 2017.xlsx" to just 20 or so main categories.

2. Tidy the Property Standards Violations dataset available at
https://data.nashville.gov/Business-Development-Housing/Property-Standards-Violations/479w-kw2x so that you have a single observation in each row and a single variable (measurement) in each column (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidy_data). This will
allow you to test the efficacy of your coding strategy from step 1.

3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Property Standards Violations data
to showcase the insight your work has enabled.
